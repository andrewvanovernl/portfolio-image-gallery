Part 2 - Portfolio Grid
In this part, you're going to make a portfolio grid. For now, we will have images in the grid, but you could put anything in it. For example, feel free to replace the image of our colleague Niels with the testimonial that you made in part 1.

Specifications part 2
Page background - gray: #c3cfe2
The grid should be responsive on 3 screens: desktop (3 columns), tablet (2 columns), mobile (1 column)
When hovering an item in the grid, a button should appear, and the image should slowly fade away.
